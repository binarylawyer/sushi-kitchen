## **Step 3: Create a Template Assembler**

Now let me create a script that can assemble these templates into full compose files:

```python:scripts/assemble-templates.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
🍣 Sushi Kitchen — Template Assembler

This script assembles individual service templates into complete Docker Compose files.
It reads the manifest resolver output and combines the appropriate templates.
"""

import argparse
import yaml
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Dict, List, Set

def load_template(template_path: Path) -> Dict:
    """Load a service template"""
    if not template_path.exists():
        return {}
    
    with open(template_path, 'r') as f:
        return yaml.safe_load(f)

def assemble_compose(roll_ids: Set[str], templates_dir: Path) -> Dict:
    """Assemble compose file from templates"""
    compose = {
        'version': '3.9',
        'services': {},
        'volumes': {},
        'networks': {
            'sushi-net': {
                'driver': 'bridge'
            }
        }
    }
    
    for roll_id in roll_ids:
        template_file = templates_dir / f"{roll_id}.yml"
        template = load_template(template_file)
        
        if template and 'services' in template:
            # Merge services
            for service_name, service_config in template['services'].items():
                compose['services'][service_name] = service_config
            
            # Merge volumes
            if 'volumes' in template:
                compose['volumes'].update(template['volumes'])
    
    return compose

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Assemble Docker Compose from templates')
    parser.add_argument('--rolls', nargs='+', help='Roll IDs to include')
    parser.add_argument('--output', help='Output file path')
    parser.add_argument('--templates-dir', default='compose/templates', help='Templates directory')
    
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    if not args.rolls:
        parser.error('Must specify --rolls')
    
    templates_dir = Path(args.templates_dir)
    if not templates_dir.exists():
        print(f"Error: Templates directory '{templates_dir}' not found")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    roll_ids = set(args.rolls)
    compose = assemble_compose(roll_ids, templates_dir)
    
    # Output
    if args.output:
        output_path = Path(args.output)
        output_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
        with open(output_path, 'w') as f:
            yaml.dump(compose, f, default_flow_style=False, sort_keys=False)
        print(f"Assembled compose file: {output_path}")
    else:
        print(yaml.dump(compose, default_flow_style=False, sort_keys=False))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```

## **Step 4: Create a Hybrid Generator**

Now let me create a hybrid approach that combines the manifest resolver with template assembly:

```python:scripts/generate-compose-hybrid.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
🍣 Sushi Kitchen — Hybrid Manifest-to-Compose Generator

This script combines manifest resolution with template assembly for more
realistic Docker Compose generation.

    """Load a service template"""
    if not template_path.exists():
        return {}
    
    with open(template_path, 'r') as f:
        return yaml.safe_load(f)

def assemble_from_templates(roll_ids: Set[str], templates_dir: Path) -> Dict:
    """Assemble compose file from templates"""
    compose = {
        'version': '3.9',

        'networks': {
            'sushi-net': {

    }
    
    for roll_id in roll_ids:

            for service_name, service_config in template['services'].items():
                compose['services'][service_name] = service_config
            
            # Merge volumes
            if 'volumes' in template:
                compose['volumes'].update(template['volumes'])
    
    return compose

    if not any([args.platter, args.combo, args.roll]):
        parser.error('Must specify --platter, --combo, or --roll')
    
    manifest_dir = Path(args.manifest_dir)

        # Generate compose
        if args.use_templates and templates_dir.exists():

        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == '__main__':

## 🎯 **What We've Accomplished**

I've created a **comprehensive template system** that includes:

1. ✅ **Service Templates** - Individual service definitions in `compose/templates/`
2. ✅ **Template Assembler** - Combines templates into full compose files
3. ✅ **Hybrid Generator** - Uses both manifest resolution and template assembly
4. ✅ **Test Scripts** - To validate the system works

##  **Next Steps**

Now we can:

1. **Test the template system** with a simple roll
2. **Convert more existing compose files** to templates
3. **Test the full workflow** from manifest to running services
4. **Update the setup scripts** to use the new system

**Would you like me to:**

1. **Test the template system** with the redis template I created?
2. **Convert more existing compose files** to templates?
3. **Test the hybrid generator** with a simple platter?

The foundation is getting stronger - let's test it and see how the template system works!
