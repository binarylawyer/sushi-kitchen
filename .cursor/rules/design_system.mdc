# Design System — Sushi Kitchen

This file defines the visual language and UI building blocks used across the web app, docs, and dashboards. Generators and linters should read these tokens to keep UI consistent.

Layout principles
Grid first: 12-column responsive grid, 24px gutters.
Cards everywhere: soft corners, dark surface, subtle shadow, strong contrast text.
Motion sparingly: use for emphasis (route changes, async loads, success states).
Components (contracts)
components:
  AppCard:
    fields: [title, tagline, status, badges, link, icon]
    badge_palette:
      stable: success
      beta: warning
      experimental: info
  RouteChip:
    fields: [ingress, public, auth_required]
  Stat:
    fields: [label, value, delta, delta_kind]  # delta_kind: up|down|flat
Accessibility
WCAG AA minimum. Contrast ≥ 4.5 for body text.
Focus states visible and keyboard nav complete.
Reduced motion respects prefers-reduced-motion.
Branding quick-refs
Tone: helpful, precise, a little playful.
Imagery: “workbench for builders”, not corporate stock.
