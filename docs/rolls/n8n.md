# 🍣 n8n Roll

## 🧑‍🍳 Why this roll is on the menu

n8n (“nodemation”) is an open-source workflow automation tool.  
Think of it like the conveyor belt in a sushi restaurant:  
it carries ingredients (data, events, APIs) from one station to another,  
so the rolls on your platter can work together smoothly.

In the Sushi Kitchen, n8n is a **Hosomaki roll** —  
part of the core platter that ties everything else together.  
It’s the first roll our Chef picked, because without automation,  
the rest of the kitchen can’t really sing.

## 🗺️ A bit of history

- **Founded:** 2019 by Jan Oberhauser in Berlin.  
- **License:** Initially under a “fair-code” license, later re-licensed under [Sustainable Use License](https://faircode.io).  
- **Community:** Over 30k GitHub stars and a vibrant ecosystem of nodes and integrations.  
- **Growth:** Adopted quickly in startups, hobby projects, and enterprises alike —  
  because it combines Zapier-style simplicity with self-hosted control.

## 🛠️ How it’s used

- **Event orchestration:** Connects AI model outputs to databases, APIs, and frontends.  
- **Glue code:** Replace ad-hoc scripts with reusable, visual flows.  
- **Automation:** Kick off data pipelines, send notifications, manage retries.  
- **AI/ML workflows:**  
  - Collect text/audio/image data → send to Supabase/MinIO.  
  - Call LLM APIs or local models → process responses.  
  - Trigger ComfyUI or Whisper for multimodal pipelines.

## 🌟 Why it’s popular

- **Visual builder:** drag-and-drop nodes make it approachable.  
- **Self-hosted:** you keep control of data and flows.  
- **Extensible:** write custom nodes or use 300+ built-in integrations.  
- **Community-driven:** strong plugin ecosystem and rapid updates.

## 🍱 Why our Chef chose it

In Sushi Kitchen, n8n is the roll that makes the platter feel alive.  
It connects the Supabase roll to the Ollama roll, pipes output into Redis,  
and makes sure the data ends up in MinIO or Qdrant without extra fuss.  

Without it, you’d be juggling Docker logs and shell scripts.  
With it, you get a **visual orchestration layer** that  
makes AI/ML stacks approachable — even if you’re not a Docker veteran.
