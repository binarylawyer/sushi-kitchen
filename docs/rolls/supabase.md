# 🍣 Supabase Roll

## 🧑‍🍳 Why this roll is on the menu

Supabase is an open-source backend-as-a-service.  
Think of it as the **rice and seaweed** that holds many of the Sushi Kitchen rolls together:  
a database, authentication system, and storage service that keeps the platter stable.  

In the Sushi Kitchen, Supabase is a **Futomaki roll** —  
big, filling, and foundational. Without it, we’d just have loose fish and no structure.

## 🗺️ A bit of history

- **Founded:** 2020 by Paul Copplestone and Ant Wilson.  
- **License:** Open source under Apache 2.0.  
- **Community:** 70k+ GitHub stars, active Discord, and strong VC-backed growth.  
- **Growth:** Marketed as the “open-source Firebase alternative,” it quickly became the go-to choice for developers who wanted Postgres power without Firebase lock-in.

## 🛠️ How it’s used

- **Database backbone:** Postgres with built-in extensions (PostGIS, pgvector).  
- **Auth & security:** Row-level security, JWT-based authentication, social logins.  
- **File storage:** S3-compatible object storage.  
- **Realtime APIs:** Streams Postgres changes to clients.  
- **AI/ML workflows:**  
  - Store embeddings in `pgvector` and query them for semantic search.  
  - Save user interactions, prompts, and responses for analysis.  
  - Act as a central hub for logs, metrics, and agent state.

## 🌟 Why it’s popular

- **Postgres-first:** full SQL power instead of proprietary query language.  
- **Open source:** no vendor lock-in, deploy anywhere.  
- **Integrated stack:** database, auth, storage, and functions out of the box.  
- **AI-ready:** pgvector support makes it a natural fit for LLM apps.

## 🍱 Why our Chef chose it

Supabase is the roll that anchors the whole menu.  
It gives us a solid Postgres base, handles auth for users and agents,  
and ties nicely into MinIO for storage or n8n for orchestration.  

Without it, we’d be reinventing Postgres + auth + storage by hand.  
With it, we get a developer-friendly, AI-ready backend in one neat roll.
