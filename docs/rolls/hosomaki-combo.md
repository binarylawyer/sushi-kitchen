# 🍣 Hosomaki Combo Platter

The Hosomaki rolls are the **core set** of the Sushi Kitchen.  
Thin, simple, but absolutely essential — these rolls hold the menu together.  

Without them, the platter falls apart. With them, every other dish has a foundation.

## 🌸 The Combo

### [🍣 n8n Roll](./n8n.md)
The conveyor belt of the kitchen — carrying data and events between rolls.  
Without it, you’d be stuck juggling shell scripts and logs.  

---

### [🍣 Supabase Roll](./supabase.md)
The big Futomaki disguised as a Hosomaki.  
Our Postgres backbone with auth, storage, and pgvector built in.  

---

### [🍣 Ollama Roll](./ollama.md)
Local LLM power, like fresh tuna in a single bite.  
Keeps the kitchen cooking even when the cloud stove is off.  

---

### [🍣 Redis Roll](./redis.md)
Fast, thin, and binding — like the seaweed wrap.  
Queues, cache, and pub/sub that keep the platter moving smoothly.  

---

### [🍣 MinIO Roll](./minio.md)
The rice bed that stores our ingredients.  
S3-compatible buckets for datasets, models, and assets.  

---

### [🍣 Qdrant Roll](./qdrant.md)
The crisp cucumber of the combo.  
Vector search and embeddings, keeping LLMs grounded in context.

## 🧑‍🍳 Why the Chef chose this platter

The Hosomaki Combo is the **starter set** for every AI/ML kitchen:  

- n8n moves the data.  
- Supabase anchors the backend.  
- Ollama serves models locally.  
- Redis manages state and speed.  
- MinIO stores the ingredients.  
- Qdrant retrieves the context.  

Together, they form the **core conveyor belt of Sushi Kitchen**,  
a balanced set of rolls that make every other dish possible.
