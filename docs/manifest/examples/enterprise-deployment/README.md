# üç£ Enterprise RAG Deployment Example

*How the same document question-answering system transforms when enterprise security, monitoring, and compliance requirements are applied*

## Executive Summary

**Scenario**: A mid-size company wants to deploy the same document chat functionality from our basic example, but with enterprise-grade security, monitoring, backup systems, and user access controls appropriate for business use.

**Key Differences from Basic Setup**:
- **Security**: Single sign-on (SSO), network segmentation, audit logging
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive system monitoring, alerting, performance tracking  
- **Backup**: Automated backups with encryption and retention policies
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions, user management, session controls
- **Compliance**: Audit trails, data retention policies, security reporting

**Target Users**: IT administrators, platform engineers, security teams

## Business Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Document Processing**: Same core functionality as basic setup - upload documents and ask questions
2. **User Management**: Multiple users with different access levels (admin, editor, viewer)
3. **Single Sign-On**: Integration with company Active Directory or LDAP
4. **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of user actions and system events
5. **Data Backup**: Automated daily backups with 90-day retention
6. **System Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring with alerts for system issues

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Security**: Network isolation, encrypted communications, secure authentication
2. **Availability**: 99.5% uptime during business hours (8am-6pm)
3. **Performance**: Support 50 concurrent users, <3 second response times
4. **Scalability**: Ability to scale to 200 users and 10,000 documents
5. **Compliance**: Audit-ready logging and reporting for security reviews

## Architecture Evolution

### From Basic to Enterprise

The manifest system transforms the basic setup by automatically adding enterprise capabilities:

#### Core Services (Enhanced)
- **Ollama**: Same LLM inference but with production settings and monitoring
- **AnythingLLM**: Enhanced with SSO integration and audit logging
- **Qdrant**: Production configuration with backup and monitoring
- **PostgreSQL**: Enterprise setup with replication and backup

#### Added Enterprise Services
- **Authentik**: SSO identity provider with LDAP integration
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and monitoring
- **Grafana**: Dashboards and alerting
- **Caddy**: Reverse proxy with SSL termination and security headers
- **Backup Service**: Automated backup with encryption

#### Enhanced Configuration
- **Network Profile**: `business_confidential` with network segmentation
- **Environment**: `production` with optimized performance and security
- **Security**: Comprehensive access controls and audit logging

## Manifest System Processing

### Service Selection Evolution

Starting from the basic combo, enterprise requirements drive additional service selection:

```yaml
# Original selection
base_combo: combo.chat-local
includes: [hosomaki.ollama, hosomaki.anythingllm]

# Enterprise enhancement selection  
additional_services:
  - gunkanmaki.authentik    # SSO and user management
  - inari.prometheus        # Metrics collection
  - inari.grafana          # Monitoring dashboards
  - hosomaki.caddy         # Reverse proxy and SSL
  
# Automatic additions for enterprise requirements

  - futomaki.postgresql    # Relational storage (enhanced config)
  - futomaki.redis         # Session storage for SSO
```

### Configuration Transformations

The manifest system applies enterprise-grade configurations:

#### Network Segmentation (business_confidential profile)
```yaml
# Frontend Network: User-facing services
frontend_tier:
  - hosomaki.caddy         # Reverse proxy
  - gunkanmaki.authentik   # Authentication portal

# Backend Network: Processing services  
backend_tier:
  - hosomaki.anythingllm   # Document chat interface
  - hosomaki.ollama        # LLM inference
  - inari.prometheus       # Metrics collection

# Data Network: Storage services
data_tier:
  - futomaki.postgresql    # Application database
  - futomaki.qdrant        # Vector database
  - futomaki.redis         # Session cache
```

#### Security Enhancements
```yaml
# Authentication and authorization
auth_config:
  sso_provider: authentik
  session_timeout: 8_hours
  mfa_required: true
  password_policy: enterprise

# Network security

  firewall_rules: restrictive

# Audit logging
audit_config:
  log_all_access: true
  log_retention: 90_days
  log_encryption: true
  compliance_reports: weekly
```

#### Monitoring and Alerting
```yaml
# Monitoring stack
monitoring_config:
  metrics_retention: 30_days
  alerting_enabled: true
  dashboard_access: role_based
  
# Alert thresholds
alerts:
  cpu_usage: 80%
  memory_usage: 85%
  disk_usage: 90%
  response_time: 3_seconds
  error_rate: 1%
```

## Generated Enterprise Architecture

### Data Flow and Security

#### User Authentication Flow
1. **User Access**: User navigates to company.com/docs
2. **Proxy**: Caddy receives request, enforces HTTPS and security headers
3. **Authentication**: Authentik checks for valid session
4. **SSO Integration**: If not authenticated, redirects to company LDAP/AD
5. **Authorization**: Authentik verifies user permissions for document access
6. **Application Access**: Authenticated user reaches AnythingLLM interface

#### Document Processing Flow
1. **Upload**: Authenticated user uploads document through AnythingLLM
2. **Processing**: AnythingLLM processes document using Ollama for embeddings
3. **Storage**: Document embeddings stored in Qdrant, metadata in PostgreSQL
4. **Audit**: All actions logged to audit trail with user identity
5. **Backup**: Nightly backup captures all document data with encryption

#### Query Processing Flow
1. **Question**: User asks question about documents
2. **Vector Search**: AnythingLLM queries Qdrant for relevant document chunks
3. **LLM Inference**: Ollama generates answer based on context
4. **Monitoring**: Prometheus captures performance metrics
5. **Audit**: Query and response logged for compliance

## Monitoring and Management

### System Dashboards

#### 1. Executive Dashboard
- **System Health**: Overall status of all services
- **User Activity**: Active sessions, document uploads, queries per hour
- **Performance**: Average response times, system resource utilization
- **Security**: Failed login attempts, security alerts, audit summary

#### 2. Operations Dashboard  
- **Infrastructure**: CPU, memory, disk, network utilization per service
- **Application**: Request rates, error rates, response times
- **Database**: Query performance, connection pools, transaction rates
- **Storage**: Document counts, vector database performance

#### 3. Security Dashboard
- **Authentication**: Login success/failure rates, MFA usage
- **Network**: Traffic patterns, blocked requests, security events
- **Audit**: Data access patterns, privilege escalations, compliance metrics
- **Alerts**: Active security alerts, incident response status

### Alerting Strategy

#### Critical Alerts (Immediate Response)
- Service downtime (any core service unavailable)
- Database connection failures
- Authentication system failures
- Disk space critical (>95% full)
- Multiple failed login attempts (potential attack)

#### Warning Alerts (Business Hours Response)
- High response times (>3 seconds average)
- High resource utilization (>80% CPU/memory)
- Backup failures
- Certificate expiration warnings (<30 days)
- Performance degradation trends

#### Informational Alerts (Daily Review)
- User activity summaries
- System performance reports
- Security audit summaries
- Capacity planning recommendations

## Security and Compliance
