# üç£ Ollama

> Ollama packages cap.llm-api, cap.embeddings for operators who rely on the Hosomaki lineup. It currently ships inside combos combo.chat-local; bentos bento.ai-agent-foundation; platters platter.hosomaki-core, platter.omakase, platter.voice-first, giving readers a direct path to Compose-ready bundles. Expect CPU ‚â• 2 cores ¬∑ RAM ‚â• 4096 MB ¬∑ Storage ‚â• 50 GB ¬∑ GPU VRAM ‚â• 8192 MB, based on the manifest's resource envelope. The enriched front matter above aligns with Sushi Kitchen's manifest exports so MCP servers can cite this roll as an authoritative source.

## üç± Quick service snapshot

| Attribute | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Roll style** | Hosomaki |
| **Service ID** | hosomaki.ollama |
| **Primary capabilities** | cap.llm-api, cap.embeddings |
| **Bundled in** | Combos: combo.chat-local; Bento boxes: bento.ai-agent-foundation; Platters: platter.hosomaki-core, platter.omakase, platter.voice-first |
| **Resource profile** | CPU ‚â• 2 cores ¬∑ RAM ‚â• 4096 MB ¬∑ Storage ‚â• 50 GB ¬∑ GPU VRAM ‚â• 8192 MB |
| **Best for** | Local LLM engine with a huge community. |

This manifest-backed snapshot highlights runtime expectations and bundle placement so contributors
can jump straight into Compose planning.

## üß≠ Origin story & evolution

Ollama emerged as a community-driven answer to teams demanding self-hosted alternatives for mission-
critical workflows. Early adopters flocked to it because the Hosomaki style prioritizes pragmatic
defaults and fast iteration, making the service approachable even before Sushi Kitchen captured it
in manifests.

Throughout successive releases the project invested heavily in stability, container ergonomics, and
API compatibility. Those milestones are reflected in today's manifest contract‚Äîports, environment
variables, and health checks are codified so Compose automation works exactly the same on every
deployment.

As Sushi Kitchen matured, Ollama graduated into bundles like platter.hosomaki-core, platter.omakase,
platter.voice-first, proving it could anchor sophisticated scenarios without abandoning its tinkerer
roots. That heritage continues to shape roadmap priorities focused on openness and operator
empowerment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core capabilities & architecture

- Provides capabilities: cap.llm-api, cap.embeddings, enabling downstream bundles to satisfy dependency checks automatically.
- Exposes container ports 11434/tcp, all recorded in contracts.yml so reverse proxies and gateways can wire routing rules without guesswork.
- Persists state via mounts /root/.ollama, which appear both in the Compose template and in the resource guidance above.
- Environment variables are explicitly modeled, letting operators pin secrets and feature flags in infrastructure-as-code pipelines.

## üç£ Role inside Sushi Kitchen

In combos combo.chat-local the service acts as a plug-and-play building block that aligns tightly with manifest capability requirements. 
Bento boxes bento.ai-agent-foundation lean on this roll to stitch together multi-service solutions without bespoke glue code. 
At platter scale (platter.hosomaki-core, platter.omakase, platter.voice-first) it becomes part of a governed architecture that benefits from shared observability, security, and storage primitives. 
Because contracts declare the capabilities it provides, dependency resolution stays deterministic whether users select rolls manually or let MCP tooling expand bundles for them.

## ü§ù Works great with

- `nigiri.open-webui` ‚Äî Popular Ollama/LLM chat UI.
- `hosomaki.litellm` ‚Äî Universal LLM gateway for local + cloud.
- `hosomaki.caddy` ‚Äî Modern web server with automatic HTTPS & reverse proxy.
- `chirashi.jupyterlab` ‚Äî Interactive notebooks for DS/AI.
- `sashimi.docusaurus` ‚Äî Documentation site generator.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment checklist

1. Use `python generate_compose.py` (or the MCP server) with this roll selected to emit a Compose specification.
2. Populate required environment variables (OLLAMA_HOST, OLLAMA_MODELS, OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE, CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES) in an `.env` file or Compose overrides.
3. Provision persistent volumes (ollama_data) before first boot to avoid data loss.
4. Validate health by curling `/api/tags` on the running container; adjust intervals if the upstream image recommends.
5. Capture the generated Compose YAML in version control so future updates stay reviewable.

## üìà Observability & operations

- Track liveness via /api/tags and mirror the interval defined in manifests (30s).
- Forward application logs to `inari.loki` using the shared logging sidecars described in the observability platters.
- Pair with `inari.grafana` or `inari.prometheus` bundles to graph usage patterns and trigger alerts.
- Monitor GPU memory consumption to understand when to scale replicas or upgrade hardware.

## üîê Security, privacy, & governance

- Store secrets referenced by environment variables inside `gunkanmaki.vaultwarden` or another secrets roll before deployment.
- Review upstream authentication toggles and disable default credentials as part of initial setup.
- Align log retention with organizational policies; redact user data before exporting traces.

## üöÄ Future roadmap

Watch the upstream Ollama project for roadmap announcements around scalability, plugin ecosystems,
and observability. The Sushi Kitchen manifests track those updates so regenerated documentation
stays aligned with real-world releases.
