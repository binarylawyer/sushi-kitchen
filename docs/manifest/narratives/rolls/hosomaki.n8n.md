# üç£ n8n

> n8n packages cap.workflow for operators who rely on the Hosomaki lineup. It currently ships inside bentos bento.ai-agent-foundation, bento.content-creation-studio, bento.content-intelligence, bento.content-repurposing-engine; platters platter.enterprise-complete, platter.enterprise-starter, giving readers a direct path to Compose-ready bundles. Expect CPU ‚â• 1 cores ¬∑ RAM ‚â• 512 MB ¬∑ Storage ‚â• 5 GB, based on the manifest's resource envelope. The enriched front matter above aligns with Sushi Kitchen's manifest exports so MCP servers can cite this roll as an authoritative source.

## üç± Quick service snapshot

| Attribute | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Roll style** | Hosomaki |
| **Service ID** | hosomaki.n8n |
| **Primary capabilities** | cap.workflow |
| **Bundled in** | Combos: Not yet bundled; Bento boxes: bento.ai-agent-foundation, bento.content-creation-studio, bento.content-intelligence, bento.content-repurposing-engine; Platters: platter.enterprise-complete, platter.enterprise-starter |
| **Resource profile** | CPU ‚â• 1 cores ¬∑ RAM ‚â• 512 MB ¬∑ Storage ‚â• 5 GB |
| **Best for** | Workflow orchestration & automation. |

This manifest-backed snapshot highlights runtime expectations and bundle placement so contributors
can jump straight into Compose planning.

## üß≠ Origin story & evolution

n8n emerged as a community-driven answer to teams demanding self-hosted alternatives for mission-
critical workflows. Early adopters flocked to it because the Hosomaki style prioritizes pragmatic
defaults and fast iteration, making the service approachable even before Sushi Kitchen captured it
in manifests.

Throughout successive releases the project invested heavily in stability, container ergonomics, and
API compatibility. Those milestones are reflected in today's manifest contract‚Äîports, environment
variables, and health checks are codified so Compose automation works exactly the same on every
deployment.

As Sushi Kitchen matured, n8n graduated into bundles like platter.enterprise-complete,
platter.enterprise-starter, proving it could anchor sophisticated scenarios without abandoning its
tinkerer roots. That heritage continues to shape roadmap priorities focused on openness and operator
empowerment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core capabilities & architecture

- Provides capabilities: cap.workflow, enabling downstream bundles to satisfy dependency checks automatically.
- Exposes container ports 5678/tcp, all recorded in contracts.yml so reverse proxies and gateways can wire routing rules without guesswork.
- Persists state via mounts /home/node/.n8n, which appear both in the Compose template and in the resource guidance above.
- Environment variables are explicitly modeled, letting operators pin secrets and feature flags in infrastructure-as-code pipelines.

## üç£ Role inside Sushi Kitchen

Bento boxes bento.ai-agent-foundation, bento.content-creation-studio, bento.content-intelligence, bento.content-repurposing-engine lean on this roll to stitch together multi-service solutions without bespoke glue code. 
At platter scale (platter.enterprise-complete, platter.enterprise-starter) it becomes part of a governed architecture that benefits from shared observability, security, and storage primitives. 
Because contracts declare the capabilities it provides, dependency resolution stays deterministic whether users select rolls manually or let MCP tooling expand bundles for them.

## ü§ù Works great with

- `futomaki.minio` ‚Äî S3-compatible object storage for artifacts/media.
- `hosomaki.caddy` ‚Äî Modern web server with automatic HTTPS & reverse proxy.
- `nigiri.whisper` ‚Äî Near human-level ASR; local and server modes.
- `futomaki.qdrant` ‚Äî High-performance vector DB for RAG.
- `hosomaki.anythingllm` ‚Äî RAG-first chat interface; quick start for teams.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment checklist

1. Use `python generate_compose.py` (or the MCP server) with this roll selected to emit a Compose specification.
2. Populate required environment variables (GENERIC_TIMEZONE, DB_TYPE, DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST, DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT, DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE, DB_POSTGRESDB_USER, DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD, N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY, WEBHOOK_URL) in an `.env` file or Compose overrides.
3. Provision persistent volumes (n8n_data) before first boot to avoid data loss.
4. Validate health by curling `/healthz` on the running container; adjust intervals if the upstream image recommends.
5. Capture the generated Compose YAML in version control so future updates stay reviewable.

## üìà Observability & operations

- Track liveness via /healthz and mirror the interval defined in manifests (30s).
- Forward application logs to `inari.loki` using the shared logging sidecars described in the observability platters.
- Pair with `inari.grafana` or `inari.prometheus` bundles to graph usage patterns and trigger alerts.

## üîê Security, privacy, & governance

- Store secrets referenced by environment variables inside `gunkanmaki.vaultwarden` or another secrets roll before deployment.
- Review upstream authentication toggles and disable default credentials as part of initial setup.
- Align log retention with organizational policies; redact user data before exporting traces.
- Mark `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` as masked values in CI/CD pipelines to prevent accidental disclosure.

## üöÄ Future roadmap

Watch the upstream n8n project for roadmap announcements around scalability, plugin ecosystems, and
observability. The Sushi Kitchen manifests track those updates so regenerated documentation stays
aligned with real-world releases.
