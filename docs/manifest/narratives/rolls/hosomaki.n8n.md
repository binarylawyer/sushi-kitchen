# üç£ n8n Workflow Automation

n8n offers a visual workflow editor backed by a Node.js runtime, letting operators combine HTTP calls,
queues, and custom code in the same flow. Sushi Kitchen leans on it as the connective tissue between
LLM providers, vector databases, storage, and notification systems. Because the project is fair-code,
you retain self-hosting freedom while benefiting from a rapidly evolving plugin ecosystem.

## üç± Quick service snapshot

| Attribute | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Roll style** | Hosomaki |
| **Service ID** | hosomaki.n8n |
| **Primary capabilities** | cap.workflow |
| **Bundled in** | bento.ai-agent-foundation ¬∑ bento.content-creation-studio ¬∑ bento.content-intelligence ¬∑ bento.content-repurposing-engine ¬∑ platter.enterprise-starter ¬∑ platter.enterprise-complete |
| **Resource profile** | 1+ CPU core ¬∑ 0.5‚Äì2 GB RAM ¬∑ No GPU |
| **Best for** | Automation builders, ops teams, AI agent designers |

Self-hosted n8n relies on Postgres for persistence, so Sushi Kitchen provisions `futomaki.postgres` or
`futomaki.supabase` alongside it. Persistent storage for the editor state keeps credentials encrypted and
makes migrations predictable across environments.

## üß≠ Origin story & evolution

Founder Jan Oberhauser launched n8n in 2019 to provide an extensible alternative to proprietary iPaaS
platforms. Early adopters were indie hackers who wanted to script API-to-API automations without the
limits imposed by SaaS quotas. The fair-code licensing approach encouraged self-hosting while enabling
a sustainable business model for the cloud offering.

By 2020 the project shipped a revamped credentials UI and a robust Postgres backend, moving beyond the
initial file-based storage. Subsequent releases hardened the execution engine, added queue mode for
horizontal scaling, and introduced binary data handling, opening the door to media workflows. The
community accelerated plugin development, with hundreds of nodes maintained by both the core team and
partners.

Recent releases focus on AI-native features: prompts can now trigger workflows, dedicated nodes call
OpenAI-compatible APIs, and the team invested in better webhook reliability. Enterprises adopted n8n for
customer operations, marketing, and internal tooling, contributing enterprise connectors and improving
observability hooks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core capabilities & architecture

- **Visual workflow editor** supports drag-and-drop nodes, inline expressions, and versioning for complex
  automations.
- **Node ecosystem** includes 400+ integrations plus generic HTTP, database, queue, and function nodes for
  custom logic.
- **Execution engine** runs on Node.js, persisting state to Postgres and optionally Redis when queue mode
  is enabled for scale-out workers.
- **Webhooks and event triggers** allow real-time automation by exposing unique URLs or scheduling cron-like
  jobs directly inside the UI.
- **Extensibility SDK** lets teams build custom nodes in TypeScript, publish them, and reuse across
  deployments.

## üç£ Role inside Sushi Kitchen

Within Sushi Kitchen, n8n is the orchestrator that glues inference, storage, and notification services
together. In the `bento.ai-agent-foundation` bundle it manages agent workflows powered by `hosomaki.ollama`
and `futomaki.supabase`. Creative platters rely on it to string together transcription, TTS, and media
processing across `nigiri.whisper`, `nigiri.piper`, and `uramaki.ffmpeg`. Enterprise platters embed n8n to
automate governance tasks, escalate alerts from `inari.prometheus`, and coordinate secrets rotation with
`gunkanmaki.vaultwarden`.

## ü§ù Works great with

- `futomaki.postgres` ‚Äì Provides the reliable database backend required for workflow state.
- `hosomaki.caddy` ‚Äì Publishes webhook endpoints securely with TLS and rate limiting.
- `hosomaki.ollama` ‚Äì Enables AI-assisted automations, summarization, and decision-making.
- `futomaki.qdrant` ‚Äì Stores embeddings and semantic metadata generated inside workflows.
- `gunkanmaki.vaultwarden` ‚Äì Safely stores credentials referenced by n8n nodes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment checklist

1. Generate a Compose manifest selecting `hosomaki.n8n` plus a database provider (e.g., `futomaki.postgres`).
2. Set all required environment variables, paying special attention to `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and database
   credentials.
3. If exposing webhooks externally, configure DNS and TLS via `hosomaki.caddy`, then set `WEBHOOK_URL`
   accordingly.
4. Run database migrations automatically on startup, then log in to the editor and complete the initial
   setup wizard.
5. Create a test workflow with an HTTP Trigger and webhook call to confirm connectivity and SSL settings.

## üìà Observability & operations

While n8n lacks native Prometheus exporters, its `/healthz` endpoint and execution logs provide insight
into system health. Ship logs to `inari.loki` and configure alerts in `inari.prometheus` based on webhook
response codes or queue depth. For high throughput, enable queue mode with Redis and add worker replicas,
monitoring database load to avoid bottlenecks.

## üîê Security, privacy, & governance

Protect the editor behind SSO or VPN, storing credentials in `gunkanmaki.vaultwarden` and referencing them
via the Credentials UI. Regenerate the encryption key only during planned maintenance with full backups,
and audit webhook URLs to ensure they are not publicly guessable. Configure role-based access control and
leverage audit logging features introduced in recent releases for compliance-sensitive teams.

## üöÄ Future roadmap

The n8n roadmap highlights deeper AI integrations, improved Git-based workflow versioning, and expanded
enterprise governance tooling. Expect more first-party nodes for model providers and a richer plugin
marketplace, which will make it easier to orchestrate complex AI agents without custom code. Keep an eye on
queue mode enhancements if you plan to operate n8n at scale.
